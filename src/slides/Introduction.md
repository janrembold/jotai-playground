# Jotai State Management for React

> Jotai takes an atomic approach to global React state management with a model inspired by Recoil.

Build state by combining atoms and renders are automatically optimized based on atom dependency. This solves the extra re-render issue of React context and eliminates the need for memoization.

It scales from a simple useState replacement to an enterprise TypeScript application with complex requirements. Plus there are plenty of utilities and integrations to help you along the way!
